# Overview

  Collectd-Plot provides a REST API for serving RRD files, as generated by Collectd.

# Development

  * Run the Tests: `bundle exec rake spec`

  * Running a dev instance
    - Install vagrant
    - run `vagrant up`
    - the service should be available on the host machine at port 8081:   http://localhost:8081
    - the service is run with shotgun, which reloads the code for every request, so edits to the source under /vagrant will be visible with the next request, with no restart.


  * Log into the vm for troubleshooting with `vagrant ssh`

# Deployment
